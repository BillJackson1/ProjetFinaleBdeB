# ProjetFinaleBdeB
This was our final project for the game programmer course at Coll√®ge de Bois-de-Boulogne

My contribution to this project was creating the weapons for the player and define their behavior, and defining AI behavior with a behavior tree.
I also worked with the animator to make the different animation states and animation key frame events.
Aside from that, I helped my collegues with other parts of the project when time permitted it.
